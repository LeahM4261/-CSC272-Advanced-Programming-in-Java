In software development, especially in Java, classes and objects are key building blocks for structuring programs. To create programs that can grow and are easy to maintain, it's important to understand the difference between them.
Class: A class is like a blueprint or a template. It defines a type of object, specifying the attributes (properties) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have. “In Java, a programmer doesn’t implement a single object. Instead, the programmer provides a class. A class describes a set of objects with the same behavior” (Horstmann, 2016, p 376). Think of a class as a general design that outlines what its objects can do and what information they contain.
Object: An object is an instance of a class. “Each object has its own set of data, together with a set of methods that act upon the data” (Horstmann, 2016, p 376). It's a tangible entity created from a class, with its own specific set of attributes and behaviors, based on the class's definition. While the class describes what objects of its type can be, the object is the real-world embodiment of that description.
-A class is an abstract concept—it doesn't exist physically until you create objects from it. Objects, on the other hand, are tangible instances created from a class.
-A class can be used to create multiple objects, each with unique attributes, but all following the same basic structure defined by the class.
-Objects interact with each other to implement the logic of a program, while the class serves as a blueprint for creating these objects.
